## Description

We developed a CRUD application to let the user track their habits, create, update and delete them.

- MongoDB
- Mongoose

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/loopey-habbits/loopey-habits
   ```

2. Install NPM packages:

3. Create a `.env` file on the root of your project and enter both you APIs keys there:

   ```sh

environment variables: explain that I'd need to create a .env file and add environment variables (remember to detail all the variables that I may need to create, if I need to create an account to get some credentials for cloudinary or an api etc.)
how to run the application (eg. npm run dev)
