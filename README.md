## Description

We developed a CRUD application to let the user track their habits, create, update and delete them.

## Instructions

how to install dependencies (npm install)
environment variables: explain that I'd need to create a .env file and add environment variables (remember to detail all the variables that I may need to create, if I need to create an account to get some credentials for cloudinary or an api etc.)
how to run the application (eg. npm run dev)

## Demo

Link to the deployed version of your project (adaptable)
